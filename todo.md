make function that takes input (point in global map to be the center of the potential field, and current postion of robot ), and computes the positive or negative potential field funcntion,(part of the funciton can be seen in equition 3). this function should overwirte the global potentialfeild 

transform the layser scan into global frame, and compute the positive potentialfield at every third point

make a function that computes the desired angle, input should be (the global potential field, and the robots current location in global map). the fuction should take equation 5 in the paper to compute the derised angle.
